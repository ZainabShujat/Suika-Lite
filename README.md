🍉 Suika — Physics Prototype
A web-based fruit merge sandbox built by Zee

https://zainabshujat.github.io/Suika-Lite/

🎮 Overview
Suika-Lite is a browser-based clone-and-twist of the viral Suika (Watermelon) Game, recreated entirely with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, p5.js, and Matter.js.
Drop fruits into a bowl, watch them collide and merge, and chase the biggest one before the bowl overflows.

Built as a desktop-first physics prototype, this project focuses on game feel, merge mechanics, and clean UI design — all coded from scratch without external engines.

🍊 Features
✨ Realistic 2D physics using Matter.js

🍓 Seven merge levels (fruit → watermelon)

💫 Smooth delayed-merge detection for natural squish

💻 Responsive layout with floating UI panels

🧩 Merge chronology panel (right side)

💬 Overlay screens for start & game-over

💾 Local high-score tracking

🌈 Custom hand-tuned fruit sprites (by Zee)

Best experienced on desktop. Mobile support is under polishing!

🌸 Developer Notes
This started as a weekend experiment to understand collision handling, object pooling, and delayed merge logic, but evolved into a full, visually cohesive mini-game.

The next iteration — Suika+ — will add:

Levels & timed challenges

Coins and achievements

Cosmetic unlocks

Mobile optimization
