## 🎮 Overview
**Suika-Lite** is a browser-based recreation of the viral *Suika (Watermelon) Game*, built entirely with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, p5.js**, and **Matter.js**.  

Drop fruits into a bowl, merge identical ones to evolve bigger fruits, and try to create the giant watermelon before the bowl overflows.  
It’s smooth, colourful, and powered by real physics — all handcrafted from scratch.

## 🍊 Features
- ✨ Realistic 2D physics via Matter.js  
- 🍓 Seven fruit levels that merge up to the Watermelon  
- 💫 Soft, delayed-merge system for squishier feel  
- 💻 Desktop-first responsive UI  
- 📜 Merge chronology panel (track your merges!)  
- 💾 Local high-score saving  
- 🧩 Landing & Game Over overlays  
- 🎨 Custom fruit art designed and tuned by **Zee**

## 🌸 Developer Notes
This began as a weekend physics experiment to understand **collision dynamics, merge logic, and game feel** —  
but grew into a polished, standalone mini-game.

The next project, **Suika+**, will expand this with:
- Level-based goals & timed challenges  
- Coins and achievements  
- Unlockable cosmetic fruits  
- Full mobile optimization
